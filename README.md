## 📁 File Structure & Workflow

The tool operates through a streamlined **3-step process**:

```
📂 RCBeamDesigner/
│
├── 📊 1 INPUT.xlsx          ← Step 1: Enter your beam data here
│   └── (Beam dimensions, loads, material properties)
│
├── 🔧 2 MACRO.xlsm          ← Step 2: VBA processing engine
│   └── (Automated calculations & design logic)
│
└── 📄 3 OUTPUT.xlsx         ← Step 3: Generated design reports
    └── (Final results, reinforcement schedules, drawings)
```

### **How It Works**

1. **INPUT** → Enter beam parameters (dimensions, loads, materials)
2. **PROCESS** → VBA macro performs NSCP 2015 calculations
3. **OUTPUT** → Receive formatted design reports and reinforcement details

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- ✅ Microsoft Excel 2013 or newer
- ✅ Macros enabled in Excel
- ✅ Basic understanding of reinforced concrete design
- ✅ Familiarity with NSCP 2015 requirements

---
